The PubChem Search utility is a simple application for for laboratory staff to quickly source chemical information. The intent of this application is to allow for laboratory chemists or scientists to conveniently generate molecular structures, or supporting information for a compound, without the need for navigating web based chemical directories.

Instructions:
  -Provide chemical ID in entry widget. Acceptable ID's include common name, IUPAC or systemic name, and CAS numbers
  -Select "Report" button

The following information is provided for the input ID:
  -PubChem ID
  -Molecular Formula
  -Canonical Smiles
  -Molecular Weight
  -Accurate Mass
  -Log P
  -Molecular Structure

The Source code for this application is provided in the repository, with intent to eventually implement the application inside of docker to provide a desktop executable for laboratory staff.
